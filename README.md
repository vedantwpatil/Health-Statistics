# Health-Statistics

This is a project which uses health data gathered from an apple watch and runs calculations on it to create statistics about the user's health. The main statistics being prioritized are calculating Vo2 max which requires calculating resting heart rate. After this I want to create a algorithm to determine how much strain the person has been going under as well as evaluating their recovery. From the information I currently know, we can calculate this by using heart rate data however there is likely more complexity involved in and will find out soon.
