# Health-Statistics

This is a project which uses health data gathered from an apple watch and runs calculations on it to create statistics about the user's health. The main statistics being prioritized are calculating Vo2 max which requires calculating resting heart rate. After this I want to create a algorithm to determine how much strain the person has been going under as well as evaluating their recovery. From the information I currently know, we can calculate this by using heart rate data however there is likely more complexity involved in and will find out soon.

I have decided to make this project be the hub of my fitness calculations. There is a separate data folder which holds all my personal data tracked by my apple watch and exported to be used. The scripts will all work, just replace the file path and add your own data from your apple watch. 

I have added a weight tracking script which logs your weight into a spreadsheet for you to track your weight, there is another script which visualizes your weight into a graph using matplotlib.
